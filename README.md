# BASS-Sensitivity-Analysis
This is a toy problem on how to use Bayesian Adaptive Spline Surface (BASS) method for sensitivity analysis.  
Users need to clone/download the R scripts and then run the code.  

The BASS_toy_example.R uses the following steps:
  
1- Install and load the required libraries.  
2- Define a bivariate function as the toy example.  
3- Fit and evaluate the BASS emulator for a small sample size.  
4- Calculate Sobol sensitivity indices using the emulator.  
5- Repeat the analysis for a large sample size.
